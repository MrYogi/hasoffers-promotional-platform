<h2>Your Application</h2>
<p>
	Your application is an overlay of the core directory. Anything the core needs
	to do, it looks in your app directory first, and if it cannot find your 
	definition of it, it will go to the core version next. This allows you to 
	redefine certain areas, like main templates and other resource files.
