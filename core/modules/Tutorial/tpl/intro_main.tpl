<h1>Welcome to the Nth framework!</h1>
<p>
	This framework was designed and created after thurough use and frustration
	with various popular frameworks.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Modular Design</h3>
<p>
	Everything is either a library, or a module (which can contain libraries).
	Modules have their own class prefixed based namespace and contain their own
	css, js, templates, and libraries which can be transported, used, updated,
	or removed on a clean directory basis.
</p>
<p>
	This separation of responsibility and code has been extended into the core
	of the framewor, where the application not a part of the core, meaning that
	you can use whatever version control, and getting the latest Nth code is
	as easy as 'git pull' from within core.
