This is a module class directory.

Since this is a base module (core/app) the classes do not have to be specifically namespaced. However, if you plan on having classes in a directory structure,
you should namespace them with the dir names.

E.G.
classes/Echo/Server.php <- Houses 'class Echo_Server'
classes/Echo.php <- Houses 'class Echo'
